# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
(descriptions are available on the website).

I am taking the opportunity during this event to learn programming in Nim.


## Compile and run

Execute the Nim interpreter command (or the compilation command, your choice)
with the file of a chosen day.

```bash
# compile, execute
nim c day1.nim
./day1

# just run (interpret)
nim r day1.nim
```

Make sure to execute the solution in the same directory where the `inputs/`
and the `samples/` directories are. The program searches the input data there.


## Learned

- Day 1: array processing with multiple paradigms Nim offers,
         and `collect` and `=>` macros
- Day 2: custom types and enums
- Day 3: HashSets from the `sets` module
- Day 4: split string with multiple characters, override a built-in operator
         by creating my own `func` or `proc`
